This is githubofjkâ€™s first project for The Odin Project. 

Assignment was to recreate a non functioning copy of the Google homepage to reinforce the basics of HTML and CSS.

It was interesting to think back on how I first would have implemented the CSS, versus how Google itself accomplished their CSS. For such a simple page, Google has a lot of specific and thoughtful details within their homepage.

It was also interesting to see the depth of CSS after viewing other Odin Project student sites. Among the few I looked at, no two solutions for any concept were the same,

While there is a certain satisfaction in matching the small details of Google's design, I also learned that front-end design is probably not for me. Beyond just the basics of HTML and CSS, i've gained a deeper appreciation for UX designers, and all the tiny details they must obsess over.
